# Applied Data Science with Python Specialisation Coursework

This repository contains my coursework for [Applied Data Science with Python Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) by University of Michigan.

**About Specialization**

The 5 courses in this University of Michigan specialization introduce learners to data science through the python programming language. This skills-based specialization is intended for learners who have basic a python or programming background, and want to apply statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx to gain insight into their data.

## Course 1 - Introduction to Data Science

[Assignment 4 - Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/mraty/applied-data-science/blob/master/course-1_data-science-intro/Assignment%2B4.ipynb)

Hypothesis: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. Run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom. 

## Course 2 - Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python

[Assingment 2 - Basic Charting](https://github.com/mraty/applied-data-science/blob/master/course-2_applied_plotting/Assignment2.ipynb)

Instructions: 
* Read the documentation and familiarize yourself with the dataset, then write some python code which returns a line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014. The area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day should be shaded.
* Overlay a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015.
* Watch out for leap days (i.e. February 29th), it is reasonable to remove these points from the dataset for the purpose of this visualization.
* Make the visual nice! Leverage principles from the first module in this course when developing your solution. Consider issues such as legends, labels, and chart junk.

The data for this assignment comes from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.
