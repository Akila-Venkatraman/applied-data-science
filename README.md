# Applied Data Science with Python Specialisation Coursework

This repository contains my coursework for [Applied Data Science with Python Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) by University of Michigan.

**About Specialization**

The 5 courses in this University of Michigan specialization introduce learners to data science through the python programming language. This skills-based specialization is intended for learners who have basic a python or programming background, and want to apply statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx to gain insight into their data.

## Course 1 - Introduction to Data Science

[Assignment 4 - Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/mraty/applied-data-science/tree/master/course-1_data-science-intro)

Hypothesis: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. Run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom.
